# Mapping ESG Patterns to AI Governance (Public)

## TL;DR
- ESG and AI governance both balance substance and optics.
- Optics can create political space for real change, but can also crowd out technical work.
- Use lightweight metrics, clear accountability, and staged adoption.

## Problem framing (PUBLIC)
Both ESG and AI governance mix measurement, signaling, and behavior change. The challenge is aligning incentives so the signaling enables—not replaces—substantive progress.

## What good looks like (PUBLIC)
- Publish a short, living risk register (updated quarterly).
- Pair each public statement with one measurable change (policy, process, or dataset).
- Create “red team windows” where external reviewers can safely challenge claims.

## Risks & safeguards (PUBLIC)
**Risks:** performative compliance; unclear ownership; overgeneralized policies.  
**Safeguards:** named owners, narrow and testable commitments, third-party spot checks.

## Metrics (PUBLIC)
- % of public claims with a linked artifact (policy/code/eval)
- Mean time to address a red-team finding
- Share of governance budget tied to measurable outcomes

## Comms kit (PUBLIC)
**3 lines:**  
- “We’re balancing transparency with real capability work.”  
- “Every announcement links to one measurable change.”  
- “We invite structured challenge during defined windows.”
