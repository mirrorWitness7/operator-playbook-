# Operator Playbook (Public)

This repository explores practical ways to communicate about AI governance and adjacent topics (e.g., ESG) with clarity and integrity.

**What this repo is:**
- A set of concise frameworks and checklists to help practitioners bridge technical, policy, and operational audiences.
- Reusable templates for communicating tradeoffs without hype or fear-mongering.

**What this repo is not:**
- A doom catalogue or a PR engine.
- A substitute for peer review or legal advice.

## Why a two-track structure?
Real work has two layers:
1) Public-facing: builds trust, creates room for action.
2) Internal analysis: sharper, more candid, used to avoid self-deception.

We publish the **public layer** here. Each public document has a private twin held separately.

## How to use
- Start from `TEMPLATE_dual_column.md`.
- Draft publicly safe content first.
- Keep specifics that could harm trust/relationships out of the public track.
- When in doubt: remove the sentence or soften to a “tradeoff/limitation” phrasing.

See example: `cases/ESG_AI_governance_public.md`
